#### Background
I'm a full-stack mobile & web engineer turned manager. I've been shipping products for over 12 years and am obsessed with building things that people love and use every day. I spent the majority of my career building, scaling, and supporting the Search engine, product, and org at Facebook. Most recently, I have been building and supporting a specialized Growth team (also at Facebook).

I currently live in Redwood City, California, with my wife and our cat.

#### Technology
My favorite technology at the moment to build with:
  - Python + Flask
  - React / react native
  - GraphQL
  - Native Android
  - Jekyll (this site is built using this!)

I've also been focusing recently on ML (especially on-device mobile vision) as well as crypto (more on the tooling side).

#### Investments
My major areas of investments tend to be in consumer software, with a large focus on FinTech and AI. My investing thesis is pretty simple - 

*Experienced teams with a ruthless vision and data-driven approach tend to win.*
