#### Background
I'm a full-stack mobile & web engineer turned manager. I've been shipping products for over 12 years and am obsessed with building things that people love and use every day. I have spent the majority of my career helping to build, scale, and support the Search product and org at Facebook. Most recently, I have been building and supporting a specialized Growth team (also at Facebook).

I currently live in Redwood City, California, with my wife and our cat.

#### Investments
My major areas of investments tend to be in consumer software, with a large focus on FinTech and AI. My investing thesis is pretty simple - 

*Experienced teams with a ruthless vision and data-driven approach tend to win.*
