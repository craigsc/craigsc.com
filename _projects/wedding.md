Website for my wedding, including a home-grown RSVP system (because I apparently love pain), interactive gallery, and mobile-ready responsive design. Little known fact: I actually found, root-caused, and reported a Chrome bug in how it calculated and performed repaints when done on the GPU (due to some of the weird image-scroll techniques I used). Happy to report the bug is now fixed on their end!
