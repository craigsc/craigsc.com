A full-featured and fully functioning clone of the formerly popular Secret app. I had decided to take on the challenge of porting the app to Android when it was still iOS only, and built it from the ground up in a few weekends. This was a native android app, integrating with the Facebook SDK for the login and graph as well as with Parse (RIP) for the backend. Never launched as it was just a challenge to myself.
