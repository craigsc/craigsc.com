One of the earliest mobile ad networks (built and launched in 2010), and certainly one of the earliest "link-sharing" variants. I personally built the entire product, ranging from the SDK, management dashboards, auction system, and ad creation system. I also did all of the marketing, and managed to amass a solid set of developers as partners before winding down the network in early 2012.
